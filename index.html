        <p>Hi there, I’m Victoria! A blogger from  Milton Keynes and I work as a Social Media and Content Executive for a town and country estate agent.</p>

<p>We are currently renovating our Victorian terrace house (you can follow our journey on Instagram), and I enjoy eating good food, admiring pretty interiors, and travelling the world.</p>

<h4>Welcome to Victoria’s Vintage Blog!</h4>

<p>Victoria’s Vintage began back in <span class="inf">2010</span> when I was a bored student looking for somewhere to write about my favourite things. I now blog about all kinds of topics on my blog ranging from:</p>

<ul class="list">
    <li>discovering Milton Keynes</li> 
    <li> hotel and restaurant reviews</li>
    <li>home interior posts</li>
    <li>travel articles general lifestyle posts</li>
    
</ul>

<p>My blog is somewhere for me to collect together all the things that I love about life and the things that inspire me. I am also a little bit crafty and sometimes post about my home and DIY projects on here too.</p>

<p class="inf">I hope you enjoy reading my home, travel, food, and lifestyle blog!</p>

        
        
        <h2 id="cont2">Holidays to Malta</h2>
        <h6>1.09.2021</h6>
        
        <p>At the end of September we enjoyed a short holiday to the <span class="inf">tiny Mediterranean island of Malta!</span> I visited Malta a lot as a child as my Mum is Maltese, so we used to go every couple of years to visit family and soak up a bit of Mums culture. I hadn’t been for almost <span class="inf">10 years</span> so I was very excited to revisit the island again, but independently as an adult this time!</p>

<p>As a kid I wasn’t really interested in culture and history, all I wanted to do was swim in the pool. So this time I wanted to full on explore everything there is to see and discover as much as I could on the beautiful island! Schofields Insurance recently ran a survey which has shown that <span id="und">for 40% of millennials, how pretty a destination will look on <a href="https://www.instagram.com">Instagram</a> is a major deciding factor in where they go</span>. Admittedly, I was excited to visit <span class="inf"span>The Blue Lagoon</span> mainly because I wanted to get some good snaps for Instagram! And I also spent a bit of time ‘researching’ places to go via Instagram, checking out relevant hashtags and location tags. Malta is very Instagram-able though so I had no problem with finding pretty places to visit and take photos. I’ve only included a very small selection of photos within this blog post but I took loads!
